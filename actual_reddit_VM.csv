Comment,3,ek0a3jp,,0,1554303456,"Measles has never been eliminated. There have been cases every year since the introduction of the vaccine. Numbers vary by year. In 1982, there were 1,697 reported cases of measles in the US and public health officials stated that elimination was around the corner. Then a resurgence occurred between 1989-1991 with over 53,000 cases.  As a result of this increase, children were required to get a second dose of the vaccine. 

In the year 2000, when the US declared it ""eradicated,"" there were still 86 cases of measles. 

Then take into account vaccine strain virus shedding after MMR. Reports of throat, blood, and urine samples all testing positive for vaccine strain measles infection up to 5 weeks from vaccination.

It compares children receiving the thimerosal containing Hepatitis B vaccine during the first month of life. The results of this study were never released by the CDC and an abstract was only obtained under FOIA request. 

Children vaccinated with Hepatitis B vaccine in the first month of life compared to children receiving no vaccines in the first month of life had an increased risk of 762% for autism, 829% for ADHD, 638% for ADD, 565% for tics, 498% for sleep disorders, and 206% for speech delays.

Vaccine strain isn't the same as the pathogenic strain. This isn't scary for anyone except those undergoing chemotherapy and other immune-depleting situations.

>During the 2015 California measles outbreak, many suspected cases actually occurred in persons who were recently vaccinated.

[Wrong](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6406a5.htm?s_cid=mm6406a5_w):

>>Among the 110 California patients, 49 (45%) were unvaccinated; five (5%) had 1 dose of measles-containing vaccine, seven (6%) had 2 doses, one (1%) had 3 doses, 47 (43%) had unknown or undocumented vaccination status, and one (1%) had immunoglobulin G seropositivity documented, which indicates prior vaccination or measles infection at an undetermined time.

Which is entirely consistent with vaccination efficacy.

>194 measles virus sequences were collected in 2015, with 73 cases found to have actually been vaccine strain measles.

Wrong again:

>>The source of the initial Disney theme park exposure has not been identified. Specimens from 30 California patients were genotyped; all were measles genotype B3, which has caused a large outbreak recently in the Philippines, but has also been detected in at least 14 countries and at least six U.S. states in the last 6 months (1).

Vaccine strain is not capable of causing wild-type disease.

>2011 New York, report of 88 person measles outbreak started by a twice-vaccinated individual.

Wow, let's hope this isn't a common occurrence. From your source:

>>**This is the first report** of measles transmission from a twice-vaccinated individual with documented secondary vaccine failure.

Impressive. You've convinced me fully. We should stop vaccinating.

>Can measles truly be eliminated if the live virus continues to be injected into the population with vaccines?

Yep. Happened with smallpox, and from entire hemispheres with polio and measles. Did you forget that?

I just explained it. I thought you were the other poster who is an antivaxxer. I provided a general resource debunking the core pillars of antivaxxer nonsense.

>Here is an explanation of how I calculated the measles death rate (including the 1 in 250 estimate) 

Great, let's break that down.

>CDC lists a death rate up to 1 in 500, but mentions that before the vaccine there were thought to be 3-4 million cases and 500 deaths each year, which would be a 1 in 6,000-8,000 death rate 

There are three incongruous parts meshed together with one bad assumption:

1) The mortality rate of measles is ""up to 1:500""

2) Pre-1963, there were an estimated 3-4 million cases of measles annually

3) Pre-1963, there were 500 deaths annually

For the third point, this is, according to the CDC source, from reported measles deaths. This is not an estimate, it is an average value of actual, reported cases. This is true for pre-1963 era.

For the second, this is an estimate of the total measles morbidity annually prior to 1963. This is probably accurate for pre-1963 era, but comes loaded with a 25-33% error range, not including a particular confidence interval. 

For the first, the mortality rate is based on data from both before 1963 and after. This is derived from confirmed measles cases and confirmed measles deaths. Nuance is lost in the first point since you've lost the range, which is 1-2 per 1000. Additionally, this value is reported in an intuitive way (X per 1000) rather than the more scientifically meaningful way, a decimal number (2.0 per 1000; 0.63 per 1000). You can make the denominator increase or decrease 'large' amounts for relatively small movements in actual case fatality rates and with no or little meaningful statistical resolution between the two. 

And to belabor the point I've already made, you are comparing **estimated** morbidity with **known** mortality. That is apples to oranges. If you had an estimate of morbidity with an estimate of mortality, you could have at it. What's interesting, then, is that to get your 1:250 number you compare **known** cases with **known** mortality, not estimates. And this is further massaged by picking, presumably arbitrarily, 1994-2014. If we, also arbitrarily, include up to 1988 then we get a CFR of 0.0022 or roughly 1:450. If we just look at the outbreak of 1989-1991 we also get a CFR of 0.0022. If we just take the first five years of reported values starting at 1950--which has a combined 40 times case numbers than the entirety of 1988 onward--we get a CFR of 0.001 or roughly 1:970. Which rounds out a nice estimate of 0.001-0.002 or 1-2 per 1000. 

And yet in the first paragraph you have picked a *single range*--with no mind for data collection, statistical confidence, attack rate by age, or other extrapolation issues--while ignoring the repeatedly collected and congruent information which suggests this homebrewed estimate is wrong or not informative as packaged. 

But I appreciate you explaining how you calculated it. Vaxfact seems like a very dubious website, as an aside. I would like to repeat my caution that you stick to reputable sources.

Comment,1,ek37pd4,,0,1554397404,"The information I provided is not wrong. It's from a 2017 study in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology. One of the co-authors is CDC Division of Viral Diseases official Rebecca J. McNall.

[Identification of Measles Virus Vaccine Genotype](https://jcm.asm.org/content/55/3/735)

McNall wrote, ""During the measles outbreak in California in 2015, a large number of suspected cases occurred in recent vaccinees. Of the 194 measles virus sequences obtained in the United States in 2015, 73 were identified as vaccine sequences."" This proves that the measles outbreak was in part caused by the vaccine.

&#x200B;

>Vaccine  strain isn't the same as the pathogenic strain. This isn't scary for anyone except those undergoing chemotherapy and other immune-depleting  situations.

McNall contradicts that by explaining that vaccine strain reaction (rash & fever) is clinically indistinguishable from the natural disease. You need genotyping to confirm the origin and distinguish vaccine strain cases from wild-type cases.

So by you saying that vaccine strain measles is only scary for the immunocompromised, and CDC stating that the reaction of vaccine strain and wild strain is identical, it proves that the general public should NOT be worried about measles. It is a mild illness to everyone but, as you said, ""those undergoing chemotherapy and other immune-depleting  situations.""

&#x200B;

Also, thank you for showing me the 2004 Thimerosal study. You've uncovered something interesting.

The 1999 study is titled *Increased Risk of developmental neurologic impairment after high exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccine in first month of life.* It states children who received the Hep B at birth had an increase of 762% for autism, 498% for sleep disorders, and 206% for speech delays compared to children that did not receive the vaccine.

The conclusion: This analysis suggests that high exposure to ethylmercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines in the first month of life increases the risk of subsequent development of neurologic development impairment...

&#x200B;

Oddly, the 2004 continuation study is the exact opposite. Titled *Safety of Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines: A Two-Phased Study of Computerized Health Maintenance Organization Databases.*

In this ""Phase II"" study, they've re-analyzed the Phase I data and suddenly found no increased risks for autism or attention-deficit disorder.

*Conclusions.* No  consistent significant associations were found between TCVs and neurodevelopmental outcomes. **Conflicting results were found at different  HMOs for certain outcomes. For resolving the conflicting findings,  studies with uniform neurodevelopmental assessments of children with a  range of cumulative thimerosal exposures are needed.**

&#x200B;

I have a feeling that you regard everything the CDC reports as unquestionably true. But even you might find this a bit sketchy:

\- In 1997, Congress mandated the FDA to complete a review of mercury in drugs and food.

\- In 1999, CDC conducted their study, found incredibly concerning data, and instead of making it public, they decided not to publish.

\- In 2001, the CDC removed or reduced thimerosal in all childhood vaccines because of safety concerns.

\- In 2004, they published the continuation study that suddenly found that thimerosal was safe all along. And to resolve this obvious conflict in data between Phase I & II, they suggested that more studies of children exposed to thimerosal were needed. Conveniently, thimerosal had already been removed...

Clinically indistinguishable means that when OBSERVING the patient, the PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS (rash & fever) can look the same in BOTH wild strain and vaccine strain measles.  

&#x200B;

>Vaccine strain isn't the same as the pathogenic strain. This isn't scary  for anyone except those undergoing chemotherapy and other immune-depleting situations.

True. They differ on a genetic level. But they share the common physical symptoms of rash & fever. You taught me that the pathogenic strain can cause further complications like SSPE. According to the CDC, severe complications are rare. Pneumonia is said to be 1 in 20. That doesn't look bad when compared to the MMR II pre-licensing studies that got released this week. The studies show 40-50% of kids got upper respiratory infections and gastro-intestinal disorders after the MMR vaccine. That's a harsh trade-off for a virus that causes rash & fever in the common person and then gives you lifelong immunity. Unless you're immunocompromised, no reason to be scared of wild measles.

&#x200B;

>Of the 194 measles virus sequences obtained in the United States in 2015, 73 were identified as vaccine sequences

&#x200B;

>Those recent vaccinees were not infected with measles. They simply had a  relatively common reaction to the vaccination and, due to proximity  (locale and time) with an actual measles   outbreak, were initial  false-positives.

Your argument is that these vaccinees were not infected with measles. They simply had the EXACT SAME PHYSICAL REACTION as the people that DID catch the measles at the SAME TIME & LOCATION of a measles outbreak? 

Maybe entertain the possibility of primary & secondary vaccine failure. Or viral shedding from other recent vaccinees. Your faith in this vaccine is strong my friend. 

&#x200B;

Now the 1999 pilot. You got this wrong. And I'm the one that doesn't know how to read? 

>More data can do that. Weird how sample sizes work?

Actually they looked at less data. The 1999 unpublished pilot looked at 400,000 infants in the VSD. Phase I of the 2004 published study only looked at 124,170 infants in the VSD. 

>Yep. Bigger sample size.

Wrong again. In phase II, the most common disorders associated with exposure in phase I were re-evaluated among only 16,717 children.

It's so obvious that they reduced the sample size to make the links to autism, sleep disorders, learning disabilities and speech delays in the 1999 pilot statistically less significant. Then they reduced it again. Wow.  This is the same strategy Dr. William Thompson said he used with his team to bury the autism link during the famous 2004 MMR study. 

&#x200B;

Furthermore, there's a massive ethical issue with the 1999 study. If you're the CDC, and you find data that points to a 762% increase in autism after the Hep B shot, you have a duty to disclose that to the public. The CDC is the health protection agency of the nation. 

They had multiple options: 

Hold a press conference and re-assure the public that a further study would be done immediately. (This study analyzed existing data in the VSD so they could literally have done this study with a computer in a few hours). 

Remove the Hep B vaccine indefintely for non-risk newborns until further study was completed. Only administer it to at-risk newborns if their mother tested positive for Hep B during pregnancy. It is a vaccine for a sexually transmitted disease given on the first day of life. It would have made zero difference. 

Either option would would have built public trust and strengthened the vaccine program. 

Instead, they hid the study. Then 5 years later, they reduce the sample sizes and publish a study ""proving"" everything was safe all along. 

Fortunately for us, the FOIA request has exposed the unpublished 1999 pilot. Now, the CDC loses credibility, and confirms people's suspicions that it cares more about protecting pharma profits and the reputation of vaccines than children's health. 

Thanks again for turning me onto the 2004 study.

You've repeatedly said nonsensical and incorrect statements as well as ludicrous conclusions from otherwise innocuous sources. Some of your links are fine. Your ability to interpret them is supremely bad.

>This proves that the measles outbreak was in part caused by the vaccine.

It proves you don't know how to read. The outbreak in California was caused by the Phillipines strain as already referenced. What the paper you *just* referenced is talking about is the ability to discriminate between vaccine measles strains and pathogenic measles strains. Your source goes on to say:

>>Since approximately 5% of recipients of measles virus-containing vaccine experience rash and fever which may be indistinguishable from measles (9), it is very important to identify vaccine reactions to avoid unnecessary isolation of the patient, as well as the need for contact tracing and other labor-intensive public health interventions.

And the part you liked to leave out, because you are dishonest and in over your head:

>>Of the 194 measles virus sequences obtained in the United States in 2015, 73 were identified as vaccine sequences (R. J. McNall, unpublished data). 

>>Genotyping is used to confirm the origin of an outbreak and to exclude endemic circulation, but it is also the only way to distinguish vaccine strains from wild-type viruses. 

Those recent vaccinees were not infected with measles. They simply had a relatively common reaction to the vaccination and, due to proximity (locale and time) with an actual measles outbreak, were initial false-positives.

>McNall contradicts that by explaining that vaccine strain reaction (rash & fever) is clinically indistinguishable from the natural disease.

No they don't. How else, then, can the PCR test distinguish them if they are indistinguishable? How else, then, do public health authorities justify quarantine for those with measles rather than vaccination reactions? You know, like McNall says here:

>>During measles outbreak investigations, rapid detection of measles vaccine reactions is necessary to avoid unnecessary public health interventions.

And also in **the first line of the paper**:

>>During measles outbreaks, it is important to be able to rapidly distinguish between measles cases and vaccine reactions to avoid unnecessary outbreak response measures such as case isolation and contact investigations. 

>and CDC stating that the reaction of vaccine strain and wild strain is identical

They don't. Even in *your source* they are clearly distinguishable. The measles component is twice attenuated and not pathogenic. It can cause a rash and fever. It does not cause CNS damage, immune repertoire depletion, or SSPE--hallmarks of pathogenic measles. 

>Also, thank you for showing me the 2004 Thimerosal study. You've uncovered something interesting.

Wait, you mean the study that was only accessed by FOIA and was buried by the CDC, never to be released to the public? Yeah, imagine that...

>The 1999 study

Except it's a pilot study given a presentation. It wasn't a paper yet. Further data collection resulted in a complete study, published in 2004.

>Oddly, the 2004 continuation study is the exact opposite. Titled Safety of Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines: A Two-Phased Study of Computerized Health Maintenance Organization Databases.

Comment,1,elnv8rx,,0,1556119082,"> recipients of measles virus-containing vaccine EXPERIENCE RASH AND FEVER which may be INDISTINGUISHABLE from measles

The rash and fever are not the total of the measles pathology. Literally the entire point of the paper you cite is to distinguish in a rapid way wild type pathogenic measles from reactions to MMR. It is literally the justification for their assay, funding, and paper that MMR does not and cannot cause wild-type measles pathology. *Some* aspects make the distinction difficult. Try as you might, they are not equivalent and your source makes that clear.

>Clinically indistinguishable means that when OBSERVING the patient, the PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS (rash & fever) can look the same in BOTH wild strain and vaccine strain measles.

Yes the FEVER and the RASH can BOTH be SIMILAR in wild type MEASLES or a REACTION to the MEASLES component of the MMR VACCINE. NOWHERE do the AUTHORS suggest THAT wild-type measles IS clinically identical IN consequence TO the measles VACCINE component. 

>True. They differ on a genetic level. But they share the common physical symptoms of rash & fever.

And they also don't share other pathologies, hence the distinction being important from a public heath standpoint. You keep ignoring this.

>You taught me that the pathogenic strain can cause further complications like SSPE. According to the CDC, severe complications are rare. Pneumonia is said to be 1 in 20.

Death is about 1-2 per 1000 for wild-type measles, as well as immune repertoire depletion, deafness, pneumonia you mention, encephahlitis you mention. This doesn't happen with the vaccine component.

>The studies show 40-50% of kids got upper respiratory infections and gastro-intestinal disorders after the MMR vaccine.

Link it if you want me to consider it in our discussion.

>That's a harsh trade-off for a virus that causes rash & fever in the common person

And would kill thousands annually unnecessarily, along with the sequelae we've mentioned previously. But, sure, let's equate increased risk of a cold with measles pathology.

>and then gives you lifelong immunity.

You can get lifelong immunity *and* avoid the disease with vaccines. Immunity isn't the goal--avoiding the disease and its ramifications is.

>Unless you're immunocompromised, no reason to be scared of wild measles.

We've literally mentioned excellent reasons, such as the unnecessary deaths of thousands and other bad sequelae. All of which has disappeared from the US due to vaccination. 

>Your argument is that these vaccinees were not infected with measles. They simply had the EXACT SAME PHYSICAL REACTION as the people that DID catch the measles at the SAME TIME & LOCATION of a measles outbreak?

That's not my argument--that's what your study says. They didn't have the exact same physical reaction, they had a fever and rash. They were not shedding measles virus, they were potentially shedding attenuated measles vaccine virus. They were not having a risk of pneumonia, encephalitis, or death. They were having an uncommon reaction to the vaccine strain.

>Maybe entertain the possibility of primary & secondary vaccine failure. Or viral shedding from other recent vaccinees. Your faith in this vaccine is strong my friend.

Vaccination failure exists. The solution is to titer and re-vaccinate, or rely on herd immunity.

As for shedding from recent vaccinees, they'd be shedding attenuated vaccine virus. Which, again, is not pathogenic.

There's no faith at play here.

>Now the 1999 pilot. You got this wrong. And I'm the one that doesn't know how to read?

Either unable or unwilling, yes.

>Actually they looked at less data. The 1999 unpublished pilot looked at 400,000 infants in the VSD. Phase I of the 2004 published study only looked at 124,170 infants in the VSD.

Ah, here's that inability to read again. Let's fact check this bit.

>>We assessed the risk for neurologic and renal impairment associated with past exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccine using automated data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD). VSD is a large linked database from four health maintenance organizations in Washington, Oregon and California, containing immunization, medical visit and demographic data on over 400,000 infants born between '91 and '97.

There are 400,000 infants in the VSD. That doesn't mean all were appropriate or selected for in their analysis. So you're already off base here. But it gets better.

>>A 2-phased retrospective cohort study was
conducted using computerized health maintenance organization (HMO) databases. Phase I screened for associations between neurodevelopmental disorders and thimerosal exposure among 124 170 infants who were born during
1992 to 1999 at 2 HMOs (A and B). In phase II, the most
common disorders associated with exposure in phase I
were reevaluated among 16 717 children who were born
during 1991 to 1997 in another HMO (C). Relative risks
for neurodevelopmental disorders were calculated per
increase of 12.5 g of estimated cumulative mercury exposure from TCVs in the first, third, and seventh months
of life

So, no, they didn't use a smaller sample size. The exact inclusion criteria of the abstract presented isn't known, since only the abstract has been saved. And, no, phase II doesn't use a smaller sample size or remove the first. It is a comparison of a different HMO investigating rates found in the first two HMOs. And there was no association. And, finally, this study (both phases) looks at the 1st, 3rd, and 7th month of life whereas the initial abstract is just about the first month.

This is also evident when you look at the sheer number of disorders found in the full paper's phase I as it clearly outnumbers the total of all disorders of the abstract. 

So my advice: work on that reading comprehension. You've got some words down, but the ability to interpret meaning is tripping you up.

>Wrong again. In phase II, the most common disorders associated with exposure in phase I were re-evaluated among only 16,717 children.

No, all associations and RR of significance in phase I were analyzed at a different site. It's not the ""most common"" but those with apparent RR of concern.

>It's so obvious that they reduced the sample size to make the links to autism, sleep disorders, learning disabilities and speech delays in the 1999 pilot statistically less significant.

How so? The sample size of the abstract isn't known. The paper has a combined sample size of 140,887. The significance of phase I isn't removed by addition of a *smaller* sample size. That makes no sense at all. Do you not understand how that makes no sense?

>Furthermore, there's a massive ethical issue with the 1999 study. If you're the CDC, and you find data that points to a 762% increase in autism after the Hep B shot, you have a duty to disclose that to the public. The CDC is the health protection agency of the nation.

Which they investigated. And found no apparent significance at different HMOs. And recommended further study with larger samples and consistent diagnostic criteria. In no way were the results buried. 

>Instead, they hid the study. Then 5 years later, they reduce the sample sizes and publish a study ""proving"" everything was safe all along.

You're living in a fantasy land. They published the study. You (claim) to have read it yourself.

>Thanks again for turning me onto the 2004 study.

So I posted in a parenting group on FB how my 18.5 week old has been quieter for the past couple of days. Nothing major I was just wondering if it's a normal part of development. 

Anyway so the majority of comments were delightful and reassuring but then I get one ""any recent vaccines""? And ""has he been vaxxed recently""? Damn I thought... Responded that yes he had a couple almost 3 weeks ago. Cue the sad reacts, angry reacts, comments ""his behaviour is definitely vaccine related"", ""you're poisoning your baby"", ""he's definitely acting weird because of the vaccines"" etc. Plus several unsolicited DMs stating how I'm poisoning and damaging my baby by vaccinating him and trying to sell me spray (I kid you not) to 'detox his skin from the metals'. Honestly I was shocked and just ignored it until people tried to do power moves ""I'm a pediatric nurse who sees this all the time in vaccinated babies"" and then I started defending myself and asking people to remain respectful and stick to the topic at hand. Tried to get some science in there (many laugh reacts in response) but I know there often futile. Honestly there were tens of people on this thread saying ""I came here to say the same thing"" etc. 

So I turn off commenting and edit to say thanks mostly to everyone but not the space for anti-vax opinion so closing comments. THEN I get a fricken message from the fricken admins saying I was being unkind by calling people OVERTLY AGAINST VACCINES anti-vaxxers and that I should either edit my post or delete it. Are you KIDDING me??? Someone literally said I was going to kill my baby and that he needs a detox (from a fricken spray bottle) and I'M being unkind?! Not to mention the thread full of misinformation and links to dodgy websites like whats in the leaflet or whatever it's called. 

Honestly I was so angry that out of all the thousands of things that could have affected my baby's behaviour some people jumped on the vaccines that he had 3 weeks ago, but that message from the admins really was the last straw - I was 'breaking the rules by being unkind' simply by defending my choice to vaccinate and asking people to remain respectful and stick to the topic. 

I'm just raging. I hate that people like this exist and I hate that there is so much distrust in the world I can't ask a simple question without it turning into some anti vax propaganda and a personal attack. I'm so worried for the future generations if kids are being brought up like this.

 She never believed the myths but wanted to do it for the laughs. At some point she tried to put a coin behind her palm and the coin would get magnetized to her hand. She said it felt like placing a magnet on a fridge where you feel the magnetic pulse attracting the magnet. It wasn't strong but she felt it. After an hour it stopped working.

Does anyone know how that could be possible? I don't believe in the myths either but I believe it was something else that she didn't notice but what could it possibly be? 

I say again she never believed in the vaccine myths and still doesn't but that hand thing surprised her good. She said she recorded it but I haven't watched the footage yet. She is not the type to ever troll. She is serious.",9/7/21 19:30

Reality,2,o564om,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/o564om/reality/,0,1624311086,"Humanity does not live in reality, but rather, in sub-reality. People spend most of their time denying the truth, not seeing things for what they actually are. Initially, their intuition may give them the correct interpretation of something. But then, their social conditioning overrides their intuition, molding that thing into what society wants them to think it is. Thus, they are not able to think for themselves or interpret reality correctly.

In other words, ""reality"" is what actually exists and what is actually going on, as opposed to the façade that society has placed over what actually exists and what is actually going on; nor is reality how one interprets something when in a state of psychological denial.

For example, when it comes to the government informing the public about something, most people simply assume that their government is telling them the truth. But, IN REALITY, these people have absolutely no idea what is actually going on, and do not want to admit such an obvious fact to themselves! In society, critical issues, such as what the government is really doing behind the scenes, are simply blown off as being non-issues. Very convenient indeed.",6/22/21 0:31

"Sobre las vacunas para el COVID19, compilación de textos científicos y opinión personal.",4,lace91,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/lace91/sobre_las_vacunas_para_el_covid19_compilación_de/,1,1612209373,"A propósito de los comentarios que he leído y escuchado sobre las vacunas para el COVID19, pero sobre todo de la vacuna rusa Sputnik V, me he dado a la tarea de estudiar algunos textos científicos y hacer una compilación de los mismos para hacerlos de su conocimiento, a continuación les comparto

**SOBRE LA VACUNA RUSA SPUTNIK V**  
The Lancet, una de las revistas médicas más prestigiosas del mundo, publicó los resultados de los ensayos de la primera y la segunda fase de la vacuna rusa SPUTNIK V, que demostraron lo siguiente:

1. La plataforma de vectores adenovirales humanos es eficaz, a pesar de las preocupaciones por la posibilidad de una inmunidad preexistente a los adenovirus.

2. Se seleccionó la dosis segura óptima que permitió lograr una respuesta inmunitaria humoral y celular en el 100 % de los participantes, incluso en aquellos que habían tenido una infección con adenovirus.

3. El uso de dos vectores diferentes permite lograr una respuesta inmune más efectiva.

4. El nivel de anticuerpos contra el SARS-CoV-2 en voluntarios vacunados con Sputnik V fue entre 1,4 y 1,5 veces más alto que el nivel de anticuerpos en los pacientes que se habían recuperado del covid-19.

5. Tiene una eficacia de 91.4 por ciento contra el virus SARS-CoV-2, y de 100 por ciento para evitar los cuadros graves de la enfermedad Covid-19.

Al mismo tiempo, no se encontraron eventos adversos graves en los vacunados con Sputnik V, mientras que para otras vacunas, este parámetro oscila entre el 1 y el 25 por ciento.

Varias otras empresas están utilizando también plataformas basadas en vectores adenovirales humanos para sus vacunas contra el covid-19, como por ejemplo Johnson & Johnson, que usa el vector Ad26, y la china CanSino, que emplea el Ad5 mientras que la Rusa SPUTNIK V utiliza dos vectores adenovirales, el Ad5 y el Ad26.

Vale la pena mencionar que las plataformas para vacunas que usan otros países, como el vector de adenovirus de chimpancé (OXFORD-ASTRA ZENECA, quienes por cierto están estudiando la posibilidad de aplicar de manera conjunta su vacuna y la SPUTNIK V para incrementar su efectividad) o la tecnología de ARN (PFIZER-BIONTECH), nunca antes habían sido utilizadas en vacunas que hayan pasado la FASE 3. Tampoco han sido sometidas a estudios a largo plazo sobre sus posibles efectos secundarios en el cuerpo humano, como por ejemplo los riesgos de desarrollar complicaciones relacionadas con el cáncer o sus efectos sobre la fertilidad.

**Las vacunas de ARN mensajero (PFIZER-BIONTECH-MODERNA).**  
La mayor preocupación con este tipo de vacunas ha sido su inestabilidad, su baja eficiencia para introducirlas en las células y que expresen el antígeno. También ha preocupado el hecho de que el ARN puede estimular reacciones inmunológicas de tipo inflamatorio, por lo que todos estos factores han limitado en parte su desarrollo. El ARN es una molécula muy inestable que requiere condiciones de mantenimiento extremas (de menos 80℃), se degrada muy fácilmente por enzimas y no se internaliza de forma eficiente.

Sin embargo, esta tecnología también tiene ventajas. Es relativamente más barata que otro tipo de vacunas y, sobre todo, permite diseñar una vacuna nueva en un tiempo récord. Una vez que se conoce el genoma del patógeno, en unas semanas se pueden producir los primeros prototipos vacunales, lo que la convierte en una excelente herramienta cuando aparece un patógeno nuevo para el que se necesita una vacuna con urgencia, como en una pandemia. En este caso, la rapidez es un beneficio mayor que el problema de su inestabilidad. Moderna fue capaz de diseñar su vacuna de ARNm contra SARS-CoV-2 tan solo seis semanas después de que el genoma del virus se hiciera público.

**MI OPINIÓN.**  
Por un lado la vacuna rusa aprovecha los modelos de vacunas ya probados, innova en el sentido de usar dos vectores en lugar de uno solo. Es un modelo que, si bien no tiene la efectividad que manifiestan en las vacunas de ARN mensajero, es más segura en términos de efectos secundarios adversos e igual de efectiva que la vacunas que todos conocemos hasta ahora y que nos hemos aplicado.

Por el otro lado Pfizer y otras le apuestan al futuro y a lo económico, puede que en esta ocasión tengan tropezones pero el avance que van a lograr es un ahorro en años de investigación, aún así, como el resto de las vacunas, el reto será que en el mediano y largo plazo resulten eficaces y que sus efectos adversos sean mínimos para poder compararlas con el modelo tradicional de vacunas que, guste o no a políticos y villamelones, es eficaz y seguro.

**¿CONCLUSIÓN?**  
Me encuentro optimista, las vacunas contra el COVID19 comentadas en este texto han demostrado científicamente que podemos seguir confiando en la ciencia para resolver y prevenir problemas de salud como las pandemias. La competencia entre científicos es sana y provoca desarrollos alternativos, lo que nos permite tener varias respuestas a un mismo problema y con ello se abran posibilidades para tomar decisiones que, de acuerdo a cada país, pueden ser más adecuadas para cada uno.

This post contains facts that will help you win any vaccine debate.",8,kwt886,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/kwt886/scientifically_proven_verified_and_established/,15,1610581499,"This comprehensive and thorough list of facts will help you to counter and win any vaccine debate. If an antivaxer is attacking you or making baseless/outlandish + unscientific claims, you can use this list of information to shut their arguments down immediately with facts:

\-**Vaccines are extremely safe**: in fact, *no serious adverse events* (besides injection site pain/erythema) have ever actually been proven.

\-Vaccine adverse events are notoriously **OVER** (not under!) reported. It is estimated by a Harvard study using data mining technology + VAERS reports that **adverse events are reported at 100x** (or more) the **rate that they actually occur.**

\-One study found that **97% of ""adverse events""** from vaccines are actually **nocebo effects** (like the placebo effect, people believe/imagine they are having symptoms due to fear/expectation)

\-Not **a single case of autism** has ever made it to higher courts, because the **autism + vaccine connection has an overwhelming amount of research debunking it.**

\-in 1986, vaccine manufacturers took **on increased liability** for their product to reassure the public of safety: this is because research has proven without doubt that vaccines are **incredibly safe.** Despite manufacture liability, vaccine manufactures have never actually needed to pay out any amount for any purported ""injury"" claims. The evidence is overwhelming to **debunk these claims.**

\-**Andrew Wakefield,** a public disgrace and conspiracist theorist with multiple agendas, is the **only physician or scientist** to have **ever published a medical paper criticizing vaccine safety**. His paper was later **retracted for fraud** and his licence **revoked**.

\-**Vaccine inserts** list events that occur normally in populations and **do NOT prove any causative association** between vaccines and these purported ""events"". If the events listed in vaccine inserts actually \*caused\* these effects, billions in personal injury lawsuits would be paid out --> which is *not* the case!

\-Unlike what antivaxers claim, it has been proven thoroughly that Gardasil is incredibly safe. The supposed ""injuries"" that circulate the internet in the form of horror stories can be explained psychologically by the phenomenon of mass psychogenic events, instigated by fear + the nocebo effect.

\-The MMR does not cause any adverse neurological events or damage in the brains of laboratory animals, even at doses higher than used in humans.

\-The cumulative effect of the entire vaccination schedule (72 doses in children by the age of 18 today, in 2020) has been completely and thoroughly investigated for safety, and no issues have been found.

\-Vaccines have rigorous long-term safety studies for all potential of carcinogenicity, fertility, and long-term health adverse effects, and no issues have been found.

\-Despite some ethical concerns raised, several vaccinated vs. unvaccinated studies have been conducted. It was found that vaccinated children have significantly lower rates of allergies, chronic health problems, and neurological issues.

\-Vaccines are thought to have a potential neuroprotective and anti-cancer effect, which is still being studied. It is suspected that vaccines may prevent infertility, dementia, and cancer, although further investigation is needed.

\-All clinical trials for vaccines use double-blinded trials with saline placebos, which is the gold standard in medical research.

\-The FDA has an independent taxpayer-funded committee to examine and analyze all raw data from vaccine clinical trials. Scientists and data analysts conducting this research have extensive background testing to ensure no conflicts of interest in any pharmaceutical company. This debunks the myth of ""conflict of interest"" regarding vaccine manufacturers funding their own safety studies for FDA/CDC approval.

\-There are comprehensive laws to prevent the myth of the “revolving door” phenomenon that anti-vaxers like to use as proof of government-pharmaceutical corruption. If a scientist/researcher who investigated vaccine safety has had any financial ties to a pharmaceutical company, they are disqualified from the vaccine approval committee. Similarly, once an individual has worked in the field of vaccine approval for the FDA/CDC, they are unable to accept positions as pharmaceutical-hired scientists. These laws prevent conflicts of interest between vaccine approval and pharmaceutical profit.

\-Studies of vaccinated vs unvaccinated infants have thoroughly refuted any claims linking vaccines to SIDS.

\-The USA has very high vaccination rates as well as one of the lowest rates of infant mortality in all developed nations.

\-France, which has a notoriously high rate of vaccine hesitancy, has higher rates of autism, SIDS, and chronic illnesses than other developed countries of similar socioeconomic structure.

\-Autism is “more prevalent” due to more advanced and specific diagnostic criteria. Once diagnostic criteria was established, people of older generations (age 50’s-80’s) were found to have nearly identical rates of autism to those of younger generations (age 40’s and under).

Why are the world’s top vaccine promoters frantically warning us about the unique and frightening dangers inherent in developing a coronavirus vaccine?,1,g1zp4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/g1zp4n/why_are_the_worlds_top_vaccine_promoters/,1,1586981420,"From:

&#x200B;

Why are the world’s top vaccine promoters, like Paul Offit and Peter Hotez, frantically warning us about the unique and frightening dangers inherent in developing a coronavirus vaccine?

Scientists first attempted to [develop coronavirus vaccines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22536382) after China’s 2002 SARS-CoV outbreak. Teams of US & foreign scientists vaccinated animals with the four most promising vaccines. At first, the experiment seemed successful as all the animals developed a robust antibody response to coronavirus. However, when the scientists exposed the vaccinated animals to the wild virus, the results were horrifying. Vaccinated animals [suffered hyper-immune responses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22536382) including inflammation throughout their bodies, especially in their lungs. Researchers had seen this same “enhanced immune response” during human testing of the [failed RSV vaccine tests](https://cvi.asm.org/content/23/3/189) in the 1960s. [Two children died](https://cvi.asm.org/content/23/3/189).

In this video footage, Offit, Hotez and even Anthony Fauci (in an unguarded moment), warn that any new coronavirus vaccine could trigger lethal immune reactions “vaccine enhancement” when vaccinated people come in contact with the wild virus. Instead of proceeding with caution, Fauci has made the reckless choice to [fast track](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200316005666/en/Moderna-Announces-Participant-Dosed-NIH-led-Phase-1) vaccines, partially [funded by Gates](https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/bill-gates-says-foundation-will-invest-billions-fight-stop-covid-19/MMAFTSVGKZHPTEGYKEQKMRWTWU/), without critical [animal studies](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/11/researchers-rush-to-start-moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-without-usual-animal-testing/) before moving into human clinical trials that could provide early warning of runaway immune response.

Gates (in the video) is so worried about the danger of adverse events that he says vaccines shouldn’t be distributed until governments [agree to indemnity](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/04/09/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-microsoft-co-founder-bill-gates-on-past-pandemic-warnings.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.Mail&fbclid=IwAR0RG79OtbdXUpY_ylULT6sY_Xo5D-cBQ0awSo6vGS19VnLGqB9z)against lawsuits. On February 4, 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) [website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html), there were only [11 active CV cases](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) in the USA, yet the U.S. quietly pushed through [Federal regulations](https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/prepact/Pages/COVID19.aspx) giving coronavirus vaccine makers full immunity from liability.

Arent your risk of getting shingles greatly increased if you have had the chicken pox?



If anti vaxxers get excited that your body builds natural immunity after having the disease, isnt that what vaccines do for your body except your never ""sick""?

I'm asking in this place bc I don't know where to start.
First of all I have 2 boys one is 6 (I stopped following the schedule of vaccination) the other is 6 months (never vaccinated).
Please excuse my English.
BEFORE you jump with your outraged let me clarify why I'm doing this PERHAPS I'm wrong, people won't realized many ""anti-vaxxers"" are just normal parents unsure of what is the right thing to do and they just don't trust institution for good reasons but  all of them are being ridiculized with memes for example, this type of behavior reminds me discussions from circumcised people (supposedly an advantageous practice) fluoride in the water (recently scientifically proven to reduce iq in children), the supposed benefits of Masturbation and porn consumption when I personally have a life changing experience with NOFAP while when you Google Masturbation first page shows articles from the Huffpos, Bustler etc..about the wonders of said habit.

Add this my own personal experience and people I know irl, in my quest for knowledge I found my own vaccination schedule, I got 27 vaccines before I was 18! Mumps, chicken pox, measles included, ironically I got these 3 diseases anyway, mumps at 6, chicken pox at 19 measles at 9-10.

Even worst I'm autistic irl something I'm not proud of (I live in perpetual embarrassment) this only adds more sceptisim honestly I wanted to learn from ""both sides"" but most ""pro-vaccination"" people seems to be unconcerned individuals who only enjoy making jokes and memes about the whole subject I use to be like that until the day I was a father, I have no doubts there are people working to improve the world but let's not forget sometimes science takes a while to catch on maybe they just don't know any better the bad news pharmaceutical companies do have motives to promote vaccination just check the cost of each unit your government have to pay.",9/21/19 3:15

This is how vaccines were linked to autism,12,cuzm3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/cuzm3a/this_is_how_vaccines_were_linked_to_autism/,12,1566683337,"It stemmed from an article published by Dr. Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues back in the 1998 in the UK.

In the study, Wakefield looked at 12 children with gastrointestinal issues also had neurological deficits. Eight of those children received the MMR vaccine. He concluded the article saying they couldn't prove a connection between the MMR vaccine and the gastrointestinal issues because the evidence is inadequate. Nowhere in the article he said there was a link between autism and the vaccine, until Wakefield claimed that it did in a press conferences.

His article was published in *the Lancet*, a well-known medicinal journal, and he was known to be a prestigious and highly regarded doctor( he's the doctor who identify the cause of Crohn's disease), so when the public heard of the vaccine-autism link, the public ate it up, fear arose, and vaccination rates dropped.

The article and his claims are farfetch once you look at the detail. First, the size of his studies was too small, only 12 children, making any connection seem statistically significant. There was only a few variables were studies and according to him, those 12 children exhibited forms of autism (the symptoms were not akin to autism). Not only that, his study didn't have the Ethical Practice Committee approve the study, which is necessary to ensure that the research doesn't harm its participants.

What's worse it that it was discovered after much denial that Wakefield was being funded $800,000 by a personal injury lawyer named Richard Barr, who needed evidence that autism was caused by vaccine for cases of parents of autistic children who were suing pharmaceutical companies for compensation. Five of the 12 children were even clients of Barr. Wakefield's collaborators didn't even know about the money and were furious enough to retract their names for the study. But Wakefield had another motive. He advocated that vaccines need to be safe and tells the public that the current MMR vaccine isn't safe. Prior to his study, he was applying for a vaccine patent, he wanted to make his own MMR vaccine and wanted to get rid of the completion.

Wakefield had his medical license evoked in 2005. This should have been the end of the myth, but sadly no. He moved to the USA and is still highly regarded by people. Now his MMR and autism phase is dying down, but his new topic takes the spotlight, mercury in vaccines.",8/25/19 0:48
For those concerned about thimerosal,2,cuzfzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/cuzfzp/for_those_concerned_about_thimerosal/,1,1566682500,"Everyone knows that mercury is harmful of the body as it is classified as a neurotoxin. So the thought of thimerosal being injected into our children and our bodies is concerning, since it does contain some mercury.

But mercury has different forms. The one that is dangerous is methylmercury. In terms of chemistry, it is the combination of a mercury atom to one carbon atom. It is known to be very dangerous to all living beings. Out of all forms of mercury, methylmercury is absorbed the easily and can even cross the blood brain barrier. Since, there are tiny tiny doses of it in contaminated food, like fish, which is why pregnant women are told to avoid seafood.

I wanted to clarify that methylmercury was never used in vaccines. While thimerosal does have mercury, it is not methylmercury. It is ethlymercury.

Ethlymercury has two carbon atoms, instead of one, which drastically changes its properties and abilities. Due to its size, it's hard for it to cross the blood brain barrier and it's quickly excreted.

Despite this, in 2002, thimerosal was removed from nearly all vaccines due to, not under the prove that it is harmful, but the idea that is has the potential for harm from the general public. This might have been due because of an article called ""Autism: A Novel Form of Mercury Poisoning"" . It was published by a group of parents in the 2001 that linked autism to mercury poisoning and the thimerosal was to blame. This article was not reviewed by any medical or scientific professionals, but it stirred up the public enough for the preservative to be removed.",8/25/19 0:35

But without those preservatives, vaccines will have a very short shelf life and then afterward inefficient.  Parents may question if that's enough reason to expose their children to poison. I wanted to reassure and inform that those ingredients are harmless, despite its name and known uses, because of its dosage.

Anything in the world can act as a poison or be completely harmless depending on the dosage. So just because something sounds good or bad doesn't mean that any dosage of it remains so. For example, too much vitamin A can actually poison you and damage your liver.

Here is a list of some ingredients in vaccines and their dosage, as well as some usages:

* Aluminum hydroxide: Used as a adjuvant (helps with efficacy of vaccine) in the DTap (0.625 mg). Also used antacids and in infant formula (0.225 mg per liter).
* Formaldehyde: Prevent growth of harmful bacteria in vaccine. All vaccine combined has 1.2 mg of it, while 1 kg of bananas has 16.3 mg.
* Monosodium Glutamate: Help preserve vaccines and used as a flavor enhancer. Some flu vaccines contain 0.188 mg of MSG, while grape juice can contain 0.258 mg per 100 grams.
* Sodium Chloride: Another name for salt and some vaccine have them to keep them in a state that will not badly affect the cells.
* Sorbitol: Preservative, found naturally in fruits, and also used a sweetener in sugar-free products. MMR vaccine has 15 mg and 1 stick of sugar-free gum has 1.25 g.",8/25/19 0:17

If vaccines are so safe and effective why does the industry need to tell lies? The local news just advertised 1 in 4 measles patients needs to be hospitalized... 

According to

https://www.autism-watch.org/news/lancet.shtml

In 2004, ten of the study's authors issued a ""retraction"" which stated: ""We wish to make it clear that in this paper no causal link was established between MMR vaccine and autism as the data were insufficient.""

So just how different is that from the studies conclusion? See for yourself - 

""We did not prove an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described. Virological studies are underway that may help to resolve this issue.

If there is a causal link between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and this syndrome, a rising incidence might be anticipated after the introduction of this vaccine in the UK in 1988...


....We have identified a chronic enterocolitis in children that may be related to neuropsychiatric dysfunction. In most cases, onset of symptoms was after measles, mumps, and rubella immunisation. Further investigations are needed to examine this syndrome and its possible relation to this vaccine.""

Isn't the 2004 ""retraction"" Saying the same thing as the study? Nothing was proved. 

The study was published in 1998.. It was retracted a very long time later. Why did it take so long? 

Some of the claims of fraudulent activities aim at Dr. Wakefield's payment to be a witness or a supposed link to an application for a vaccine patent. 
Have you seen how much money Dr Offit and Plotkin make from all the vaccines. They have the patent on the R in MMR yet they are often called as witness against Dr Wakefield or give expert witness for a news report.

Myth: 1 in 1000 measles cases are fatal,6,b8jhk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/b8jhk7/myth_1_in_1000_measles_cases_are_fatal/,32,1554213095,"The 1 in 1000 fatality rate from measles is a known calculation error by the CDC. 

It's actually closer to 1 in 10,000 or 0.01% of cases. 

To put it in perspective, 1 in 10,000 is the same probability of getting struck by lightning in your lifetime. (Howstuffworks.com) 

Proof: https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/critical-calculation-error-in-background-information-for-hearing-on-vaccines-save-lives-what-is-driving-preventable-disease-outbreaks-on-march-5-2019/

Prior to the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963, “there were an estimated 3 to 4 million people infected with measles in the United States, and as many as 500 related deaths each year,” which is correct. However, this computes to a number of deaths which, at most, is one in 6,000 (3,000,000 divided by 500). More precisely, between 1959 and 1962, about 400 measles deaths occurred among about 4,000,000 measles cases, which results in a one in 10,000 (0.01%) chance of a child dying from measles, not one in 500 or one in 1,000. By comparison, over 23,000 infant deaths occur every year in the U.S. and thus the chance of a child dying in his or her first year of life is currently one in 170 (0.6%)—this is 60 times the risk of a child dying from measles in 1962, a time period when almost every child had measles by age 15.

The reason this calculation error unfortunately commonly occurs is because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes case-fatality rates based on the number of reported cases only. And, since it is estimated that nearly 90% of measles cases are benign and therefore not reported to the CDC, the widely publicized measles case-fatality rate is a 10-fold miscalculation. Such an error has grave public health consequences.

Herd Immunity is it really achievable?,2,azlm88,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/azlm88/herd_immunity_is_it_really_achievable/,17,1552258302,"
In 1933, Dr. Arthur W. Hedrich, a health officer in Chicago, IL observed that during 1900-1930, outbreaks of measles in Boston, MA appeared to be suppressed when 68% of the children contracted the virus.3 Subsequently in the 1930s, Dr. Hedrich observed that after 55% of the child population of Baltimore, MD acquired measles, the rest of the population appeared to be protected. It was that observation that formed the basis for mass vaccination campaigns.4

When the mass vaccination campaign for measles in the U.S. began in earnest in the mid-1960s, the U.S. Public Health Service planned to vaccinate over 55% (based on the Baltimore observation) of the U.S. population, and it announced that it fully expected to eradicate measles by 1967. When that didn’t happen, the Public Health Service came up with vaccination rate figures of 70-75% as the way to ensure herd immunity. When eradication was still not achieved at those rates, public health officials jacked up the rates to 80%, 83%, 85%, and ultimately to 90%.

The process by which the decisions to raise the rates is unclear. Was it based on some scientific methodology or assumptions? Or were the decisions simply made because officials felt pressure to fulfill their promises to fully eradicate measles? Did they ever consider pausing and re-evaluating the original premise behind the theory of herd immunity? Or did they trudge on, arbitrarily raising the bar?

Now the rate is up to 95% to achieve herd immunity. But as we see with the continual outbreaks, even at 95% we still do not have full immunity. In China, the vaccination rates are even higher—99%. But there are also still measles outbreaks there.  So is the answer 100%? And what if at 100% you still get outbreaks? We’ve gone from herd immunity supposedly achieved at 55% to herd immunity that is clearly not achieved even at 95%. At what point will public health officials have to confront the possibility that herd immunity may not be the best theory on which to base vaccination policy?

I've learned not to challenge her on it because it's gotten me nowhere but she views my beliefs as a personal attack on her directly. She runs a supplements company and has traveled the world teaching about the dangers of vaccines and how it caused my youngest brother to get autism. It's actually the entire basis of why she's a Trump supporter because of his stance on the issue, but that's another issue entirely.

 I know the basis of the argument for vaccines (herd-immunity, diseases are worse etc) but our discussions always boil down to sources and generally what or who to believe. She has the assumption that all CDC sympathetic media or articles are in the pockets of big pharma so they can make all their profits through vaccines. I anticipate this being the crux of the argument following this movie. I don't believe I will break through to her but I do hope to get a better understanding of the issue before I go into 2 hours of full propaganda, then to be bombarded with questions. 

Here's a link of a bunch of articles she views as ""proof"" of what she believes:

http://vaccinepapers.org/

 I've gone through most of it and don't really know what to make of them. There's a lot of prefacing for the studies that are mentioned but like I said, I'm no expert. What do some of you make of these links and/or what valuable information can you give me before going to see ""VAXXED""?

Edit: So I went to see the movie and most of it isn't about what you think. Rather it's about the CDC coverup of the study that showed correlation between autism and the MMR. It's actually really compelling on that front and I urge those of you to go and watch it for yourselves and then come back to discuss what you saw. Don't just take my word for it.",6/11/16 1:15

"My anti-vax aunt just posted this comment on an article, much more cogently argued than most posts I see, and since I'm not knowledgeable enough to specifically refute anything I was wondering if one of you were.",10,238hku,https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineMyths/comments/238hku/my_antivax_aunt_just_posted_this_comment_on_an/,22,1397700368,"She's a little bit of a conspiracy nut and is super into homeopathy, but she also has a Ph.D. and has written books, so the usual idiocy isn't on display (at least rhetorically). If everything she claims in this post is true, then vaccines are the devil. I know that's not the case, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to refute most of her points, so I was wondering if any of you were.

Here's the post:

""Contrary to the view that non-vaccinators are uneducated fools duped by conspiracy theories, most have taken the time to study the scientific data that show most vaccinations not to be worth the risk. Even the Supreme Court has deemed vaccination to be ""unavoidably unsafe"".
Are you aware that, by law, the CDC sponsors a vaccine injury database called VAERS -- the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. According to VAERS data, over the past 10 years alone, 26,793 people have been hospitalized with vaccine injuries and 2,081 have died. Did you know that 162 young people, mostly healthy teenage girls, have now died after receiving the HPV vaccine?
Did you know that, in exchange for granting legal immunity to vaccine manufacturers, the US government sponsors a vaccine court that awards compensation to families with vaccine-injured children? This court has paid out billions of dollars to families, including for children whose autism was deemed to have been caused by vaccination. Did you know that a 2005 FDA report on the Tripedia DTP vaccine listed many neurological problems as potential side effects, including autism?
Did you know that one of the key studies that supposedly exonerated vaccines from causing autism was authored by Poul Thorsen, now a fugitive wanted for money laundering and fraud? And that, in contrast to what is constantly repeated in the media, there are dozens of studies implicating vaccines as playing a role in causing autism, as well as many other neurological and chronic diseases, including Type 1 diabetes (also on the rise in children)? Did you know that a 2011 study in Germany that compared vaccinated versus unvaccinated populations found unvaccinated children to be far more healthy, with much lower rates of asthma, allergies, ear infections, epilepsy, gluten sensitivities, GERD, anxiety and depression, autism, and dyslexia?
Did you know that a growing number of physicians and immunologists are admitting that vaccination may not be worth the risk? They point out that, in an effort to avoid the childhood diseases (which only 60 years ago were considered beneficial because they triggered true immunity and spurts in child development), we may be causing an increase in chronic disease and a form of disease immunity that is not as strong and longlasting? Did you know that recent outbreaks of childhood diseases among vaccinated children is not due to their ""contamination"" by unvaccinated children or due to loss of so-called ""herd immunity"", but rather, is usually occurring in completely vaccinated populations because their artificial immunity is waning?
Please understand. Parents who wish to forego vaccination for their children are not asking that others follow their lead. They simply want to be permitted to follow their beliefs and not be forced to administer these drugs to their children. Indeed, many of these families already have a vaccine-injured child. Each year, the extremely powerful vaccine industry sponsors media campaigns (like the one we are currently experiencing) whose ultimately goal is to force everyone to become their customers. As a society, we must preserve our human right not to be forceably injected and medicated against our will.""",4/17/14 5:06

It's wrong and if what you're really worried about is children going unvaccinated, you've done nothing but convince these people that they're doing the right thing because you're nothing but a bunch of haters.

No vaccine in use today has been used for hundreds of years (though that is probably a good thing)

Medical exemptions are only if you have a documented contraindication, and homeschool is impossible for some people, so yes, requiring vaccines for school does in fact force people to take them, some states also require vaccines for homschool

Comment,1,gsazbvq,,0,1616774534,"Best answer I can come  up with:  
Fever and body aches are symptoms from the innate immune system ramping up. 

But if your adaptive immune system (the kind of immunity you want from a vaccine) can take care of the antigens before they trigger an innate immune response, then those symptoms won't be as strong, if they're present at all.

Your immune system isn't *stronger,* *per se,* just you had already started developing the adaptive response and your sister relied more on an innate response. Two weeks after your second shots, you both should have comparable immunity to COVID. :)",3/26/21 18:02

Comment,1,gfttcbw,,0,1607965635," 

A study published in 1998 - since discredited and withdrawn - associated the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine with autism. But the concern it sparked among parents lives on.

“People didn't like that they were about to be injected with a biological product they didn't understand, and that was the birth of anti-vaccine movements,” Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told ABC.

Experts say, there’s work to be done to ensure that happens. As distribution of the first 2.9 million doses kicks into gear, public health experts prepare to parse fact from fiction.

“There's a lot of work that has to be done to ensure that the vaccines that come forward that we trust in them, that we trusted the science was done right,” Besser said after months of whiplashed messaging -- and years of systemic inequality. “A casualty of that approach is trust.”

“I think it's okay to be scared,” ABC Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Jen Ashton said. “It's okay to acknowledge that - it means you've been paying attention. But in medicine and science, we have to go on facts, not fear.”",12/14/20 19:07

So, 0.063% of 2763 is 1.74.

I don't know how they got 0.74 of a person, so there's some problem with the numbers, but anyway, if we assume the same ratio of the 561 group, then we'd expect 0.35 people in the unvaccinated group to have ADHD.  Which rounds to zero. Which is what we've got.

Comment,1,fx0nt4p,,0,1593971742,"Hello. I am a nursing student displaced from clinical rotation due to Covid-19. I found your post regarding your concern relating to your child’s safety with updated vaccines. As you may know, vaccination is essential because it helps provide immunity before an individual is exposed to certain life-threatening diseases such as chickenpox or measles. There is a possibility that your child might get measles for an example, but very unlikely. According to the Mayo Clinic, more than 93% of people who get the first dose of MMR develop immunity to measles. After the second dose, about 97% of people are protected. The 2020 Recommended immunizations for children from birth through 6-years old from CDC are linked [here](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf). According to the CDC, “everyone six months and older should get the influenza (flu) vaccine every season.

The argument that there is a genetic component to autism is not by itself a proof that vaccines cause autism.

 Argument X:  ""It is also often argued that unvaccinated autistic people prove autism is not caused by vaccines""

I often argue the fact the people unvaccinated for MMR  get autism at  about the same rate as people vaccinated for MMR is good evidence that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism.  The argument X above appears to be a misrepresentation of that argument by less intelligent people on reddit.

When vaccines are introduced, tests are done to see if they are safe.  They don't test for every single disease in the book.  In general, tests were not done for autism specifically in the distant past.

 Andrew Wakefield wrote a research article claiming the MMR might be associated with autism.  The article was analyzed and Wakefield was discredited and eventually lost his license.

At this point there was no reason to do further analysis scientifically on the subject.  There was no reason to think that the MMR vaccine caused autism.  Safety research on vaccines does not do analysis on every disease in the book.

However, with many vaccine opponents spreading false claims that MMR vaccine cause autism,  a large expensive research project was performed to show that MMR vaccine is not linked to autism.

  
There have not been large expensive research projects to prove every single vaccine does not cause autism.  There are also a thousand + other diseases we could study if there was money enough.  Similarly, tests could be done to see what correlations there are between every drug and food we take with every disease, but there is just not enough money for this.",5/8/20 16:26

This is a 36 subject study. It's too short and doesn't offer certainty. Either way, will discuss it again.


You missed this paragraph I guess, that the data is not showing a clear causation. 

> ""A second issue is that clearly not enough time has elapsed since the switch to aP to draw definitive conclusions about the resumption of cycles of B. pertussis incidence. While the data appear most consistent with asymptomatic transmission from aP vaccinated individuals, it may be many years before enough time has elapsed to be able to rule out this hypothesis.""


Also other disclaimers:

>Our model does not explicitly account for evolution of the B. pertussis bacterium [7, 56] — a factor which may play a large role in the epidemiological dynamics of B. pertussis. For example, it has been posited that B. pertussis has adapted to vaccination in several European countries. Mooi et al. (2001) identified genetic changes between pre- and post-vaccination strains of B. pertussis [8]. Despite this evidence, including evolution would merely increase the number of individuals susceptible to both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection and would yield exactly the opposite pattern of population genomic variation than seen empirically.



________________________________________________________________
The aP vaccine (acellular pertussis) is reliable for kids especially, somewhat similar to the rotaviral vaccine and maybe the meningococcal one too, because it offers immunity for a few  critical years, when kids are small and vulnerable. Unlike the whole cell pertussis vaccine, which gives a longer and sturdier immunity.

Nobody expects these vaccines to be efficient and create immunity per life. The same with tetanus and diphtheria. You have to get boosters to be actually protected for longer periods of time! Otherwise your antibody count will become super low and you become susceptible to the infection AND maybe becoming a carrier. Sure, not the case of tetanus, but the case of diphtheria. pertussis...

Why? Because with the aP vaccine, immunity is not stimulated enough, as there are less antigens in it to ""irritate"" the immune system and create enough antibodies. Hence you basically become unimmunized. Just like unvaccinated persons. 



This was observed in a trial for animals too. And by this, we get back to your previous ideas that unvaccinated kids are not that much of a danger. They are though, because they become even a bigger reservoir of infection.

>>""However, Merkel notes that there was a “startling” difference in acellular-vaccinated animals: “After they were infected, they became colonised and remained colonised longer than unvaccinated animals. Although they weren’t sick, they were carrying the bacterium in their airways.” When these animals were co-housed, they were able to infect other, unvaccinated, animals.

>>A similar pattern was seen with whole-cell vaccinated animals, but they were able to clear the infection within two weeks — much quicker than the acellular-vaccinated animals. “To a large extent, this can explain the increase we are seeing in cases of pertussis,” says Merkel.""

Either way, the conclusion was ok and mentioned that the more there are vaccinated, just like with polio, the less risk of contracting a disease if you have a large percentage of the population vaccinated. It's called herd immunity! And possible eradication. Look at polio, it still can be transmitted through feces, for a while after getting the vaccine. Yet in so many countries it's been eradicated.

Also, the problem is here that both the study you linked and the one I linked, failed to mention the antibody count. They're just mentioning waning immunity, which is not enough for a conclusion. 

This remains my point of argument, to what you said: you're not immunised,  or properly immunised anymore if you manage to colonise a bacteria you're vaccinated against. Aka: you need the booster.",3/23/20 11:47

Comment,6,fkxirg4,,0,1584629030,"1.) The movie they cited as their source, “Vaxxed”, was written by Andrew Wakefield. He is a former UK doctor who was hired by a group of parents to find a link between vaccines and autism. He published a study finding the link in the highly respected medical journal the “Lancet”. It was later found that he falsified the results of his study, and also performed very unethical and invasive tests on children with autism to “prove” his findings (think unnecessary spinal taps and other painful procedures). His was the first, and I believe only, article to be retracted in the Lancet in all its years of publication. Wakefield was stripped of his medical license and ability to continue practicing medicine in the UK. No doctors, in any country, have ever completed a study that replicated his results. An important factor of scientific studies is they need to be repeatable. If nobody else is getting the same results, his study is suspect regardless of the ethics of it (but that’s a huge deal anyways) I would be HIGHLY skeptical of anything that has his name on it.

2.) The movie Vaxxed is only showing one “side” of the story, if you can call it that. It’s meant to scare people and to convince them that vaccines are bad. It isn’t a sound source because it’s heavily biased and does not present all the information, only the information that supports their narrative.

3.) Vaccine injuries are a real thing. However, they are also incredibly rare. I am not a doctor, or medical professional in any capacity, so I don’t have hard science for you. But look at the number of people who have been fully vaccinated and compare that to the number of people who have vaccine caused injuries. My entire life, 99% of the people I know are fully vaccinated, and not a single one of them had any impairment attributed to vaccines. I’d do some research into the actual chances of vaccine injury. But I’m almost positive that the chances of a vaccine injury are significantly smaller than the chances of injury from other routine or necessary/life saving procedures that we don’t bat an eye at (think surgeries and the like)

4.) The hole in the logic of anti-Vaxxers that I’ve never heard them answer is this: if you break an arm, where are you going to go? Answer: the doctor’s. They wouldn’t think twice about it. I know anti-vaxxers who have rushed their children to the doctor for a high fever. However, they also claim big pharma is a conspiracy and trying to hurt you. If the vaccines aren’t safe, how can anything the doctor says/does be trusted? Either they are in on the conspiracy or they are dumb enough to be taken in by it, and either way how can you trust them? Also, the FDA approves the vaccines, and they also approve the other meds you might take/a doctor might prescribe you. How can you trust ANY of that if the vaccines are a huge conspiracy? You’re better off staying away entirely if that’s the case.

5.) The ingredients in vaccines sound scary, sure. I wouldn’t trust myself to mix a vaccine safely. However, I am not a doctor. I didn’t spend years studying medicine, and then following strict procedures and countless peer-reviewed and tested studies to have the know-how to make vaccines. Just like I wouldn’t trust myself to wire a house, because I have no experience, but I would trust an electrician. Or how I would trust a cardiologist to perform open heart surgery on me but I wouldn’t trust my husband because he isn’t a medical professional.

6.) On their whole “ingestion vs injection” thing; broccoli is totally safe to ingest. We recommend people ingestion broccoli as it’s very good for you. We do not recommend people injecting broccoli into their bloodstream. Again, I’m not a doctor, but injecting broccoli into your body will kill you. Should we get rid of broccoli?

7.) Vaccines seem unnecessary, but it’s because they work. Vaccines stop the spread of dangerous and even deadly diseases. When enough people vaccinate, it protects the vulnerable populations (elderly, very young, immunocompromised, and those who for one reason or another cannot receive vaccines). The disease cannot spread, causing it to effectively die out, or at least prevents it from becoming a pandemic. This whole Coronavirus thing is actually a good illustration of how bad a pandemic can be and how beneficial these vaccines are. Smallpox, measles, heck even the flu, all used to tear through communities and kill/injure a lot of people. Modern medicine helps, but the vaccines keep it from spreading like wildfire in the first place. When was the last measles epidemic? Or the last smallpox outbreak? We vaccinate for those, and while a case of measles or two might pop up every now and then, we aren’t shutting down cities because of an outbreak.

I hope this helps! Sorry for the novel, this is everything I’ve been wanting to say to my anti-Vaxxer friends and haven’t really been able to, so typing this up was kind of cathartic.",3/19/20 16:43

You have to take a step back from all this stuff being thrown at you and ask- if even a small fraction of them are correct, why is it pediatricians, epidemiologists, and their various member organizations still recommend their use? If the answer is ""because big pharma,"" then you will have to reassess how much drug companies make off of vaccines. Hint: it's not a whole lot.

Just a random study: that first one, let's say. 

>Four to 12 days post 12 month vaccination, children had a 1.33 (1.29–1.38) increased relative incidence

So, that works out to a 33% increased risk of whatever it is they're measuring, with a range of 29% to 38% increased risk (with a 95% confidence limit). Sounds like a lot! 

>Ten to 12 days post 18 month vaccination, the relative incidence was 1.25 (95%, 1.17–1.33) which represented at least one excess event for every 730 children vaccinated.

Secondly, many of the cited studies are going on about mercury. Thimerosal- the compound containing mercury used to preserve vaccines- has not been used in childhood vaccines for years, long enough that we should have seen a diminution in the rate of autism would that mercury was responsible. As it stands, all routine vaccines for use in those under the age of 6 [do not contain thimerosal.](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/thimerosal-and-vaccines)

>Boys vaccinated as neonates had threefold greater odds for autism diagnosis compared to boys never vaccinated or vaccinated after the first month of life.

This raises the possibility that some issue at birth is associated with both autism and postponement of vaccination, the including of 3 year olds who may not have been diagnosed yet, along with the use of ""parental report of autism diagnosis"" rather than medical record could also possibly create issues

This study was also done before mercury was removed from hepatitis B vaccine in the US, so besides the potential for confounding variables it is looking at a vaccine with a no longer used preservative (still used in certain flu shots, but not hepatitis vaccine). I don't think this is an entirely conclusive study

**STUDY #3:** This is comparing different countries, which is just asking for confounding variables, I'm not even sure I want to bother reading through a study that I can tell from the abstract is so inconclusive.

Also, the only author is  journalist who runs an antivax group

**STUDY #4** is a case report of an unusual event and is inconclusive because such case reports can't determine if the deaths were a coincidence or not

**STUDY #5** Is of an unsafe vaccine that was withdrawn from the market over safety concerns and has now been replaced with a different version [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/rota.html#vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/rota.html#vaccines)

This study also uses number of pediatricians in a state as the measure of access to care, which is ridiculous, as finance, transportation, population, geography, ect also affect access to care

Also, the author is an economist, not a doctor

**STUDY #7** Just says a whistleblower said vaccines cause autism, a lot more info is needed to know what is going on here

**STUDY #8** is interesting but jumps to conclusions, as the info provided is insufficient to establish causation, it may be that an overactive immune system causes both the autoantibodies and the abnormal immune response to measles vaccine, rather than that the vaccines causes the autoantibodies. And if the vaccine does cause the autoantibodies, then measles itself likely also would, and may present a greater risk than the vaccine

Comment,0,fijl0ok,,0,1582452969,"**TL:DR It takes time to read multiple studies, but I read though most of the first one and it looks pretty good, it suggests that around 1 in 168 kids have a side effect leading to an ER visit or hospitalization caused by the first dose of MMR and chickenpox vaccines, although most were just ER visits without hospitalization**

**I will look into the rest of them in coming days (or hours), but looking through all 39(!) will take some time**

Analysis of the first study (sorry it's so long, science is just complicated sometimes): The authors appear to be from legitimate institutions, and the methods of the study look legit, they found that among kids who go to the ER within 28 days after the 12 month vaccines in Ontario, more of them went to the ER between 4-12 days after vaccination than when to the ER on days 20-28, and this was statistically significant, using a legitimate definition of statistically significant (95% CI, and p-value <0.0001)

This suggests that that vaccines are causing kids to go to the ER between 4 and 12 days after vaccination, which is consistant with the expected timeframe for reactions to live vaccines such as the MMR and chickenpox vaccine, both of which are given at 12 months

The most obvious form of bias would be to compare time periods of different lengths, but they are comparing a 9 day period to a 9 day period, so no issue there

Another potential issue with a study like this study is that the rate of ER visits on days 20-28 is assumed to be non-vaccine related, and used as a control, so any vaccine related ER visits in this period would not only be missed but would contribute to a lower estimate of the number of day 4-12 ER visits that are attributable to vaccines, this bias would actually make the study underestimate the dangers of vaccines, but I don't know that it was a major issue based on the graphs provided

The fact that they vaccine related ER visits had almost the exact same severity score as the none vaccine related ones might suggest that the ""vaccine related"" ER visits and non vaccine related ones, are for the exact same conditions, meaning that none of them are actually vaccine related (or that they all are, but this wouldn't explain the ER visits right before vaccination). However, there was no increase in facial injuries in the period of increased ER visits after vaccination, suggesting that the increase was actually do to different conditions, ie, they were actually vaccine related. Vaccine related and non-vaccine related ER visits could be the same average severity if this is a threshold at which parents take kids to the ER, and both vaccine related and non vaccine related ER visits are rarely more serious than this threshold

The increase in ER visits after 18 month vaccinations (which include a second dose of MMR and chickenpox) was little to none, which is consistant with the fact that once you have had the 1 dose of a live virus vaccine you are usually vaccinated against side effects of subsequent doses, and this suggests that the increase in ER visits after the 12 months vaccines is either due to the live vaccines (MMR and/or chickenpox), or one of the non live vaccines that is given at 12 months but not at 18 months, although the timing 4-12 days after vaccination is more consistant with a live vaccine",2/23/20 12:16

I don't think there is any evidence for this, and I struggle to imagine any biologically plausible mechanism that would cause this. 

Vaccines are not especially burdensom to the immune system. On the contrary we encounter a dozen novel antigens per day, and at any given point our immune systems are in the process of combating 1000+ different insults (though the vast majority are mostly harmless like pet dander or pollen). 

Moreover, today's vaccination schedule is far less insulting than the one our parents went through. Today's children get more overall needle sticks, but smaller doses each time, and there are fewer novel antigens in said vaccines. In the 1960-70s they had no good way to determine which antigens to target to provoke an immune response, so they basically used brute force. Some vaccines had hundreds even thousands of antigens like the old Pertussis vaccine. Probably only a handful were relevant, but they couldn't isolate them, so they just gave you the whole load. Today we're much better at isolating the relevant ones. 

I saw a paper about this a few years back, IIRC a child born in the 2010s will be exposed to about 150 novel antigens through the CDC recommended vaccination schedule, a kid born in the 1980s probably got 3000, and in larger doses (but fewer shots). We probably get 20,000+ per year naturally anyway. As such, the insult from vaccinations is not that unusual, and in fact, far less significant than actually getting the flu or measles. I don't think there is any evidence that vaccination makes people ""softer"".

While hygiene theory suggest growing up in a sterile environment is a bad thing, there is no evidence that surviving horrible illnesses somehow makes you stronger. In fact, I'd wager the opposite. A serous measles infection for example, can royally screw with your immune system for years. 

As to your question, I can't imagine how getting routine flu and TDAP shots would make you more susceptible to something like SARS or nCov. 

I'd guess modern epidemics are the result of habitat destruction via industrial agriculture, and  reckless slaughter practices, and increased human mobility. The 2014 West Ebola outbreak was not unusual in any biological way, the only thing that changed was that modern Africa is surprisingly well connected with significant flow of goods and people, whereas 1970s Africa was isolated and most Ebola outbreaks were easily contained.",2/7/20 22:07

What? How did you arrive at this conclusion? Zika was identified in the 1950s and is very similar to its flavivirus cousins (less dangerous than most). Avian flu (H5N1) is literally just one of many flu strains.

The first coronaviruses were identified in the 1960s, and are one of several that cause the common cold. You've almost certainly had a few coronavirus infections over the course of your life. SARS, MERS-CoV and the new nCov-2019 are unusually dangerous examples, but there is no evidence whatsoever that they were engineered.

I don't see how vaccines could have anything to do with these recent spillovers either. Putting domesticated food animals in close quarters with wild animals and humans is a receipe for disaster.

Comment,1,fg5tzh0,,0,1580538818,"A ""boosted"" immune system is what would be called an autoimmune disorder and is not a good thing. Vaccines provide the building blocks for your immune system to properly fight off a virus when it comes into contact with one. It allows your body to make antibodies to these diseases. Generally, without being vaccinated, your body has to have time to make these cell mediated responses and fight off the infection, then it's stored in your immune systems memory. Vaccines allow you to create this memory without contracting the actual disease. Some of the things we vaccinate for don't have a good prognosis either, like tetanus or polio.",2/1/20 8:33
Comment,1,fg42hh5,,0,1580494779,"It is quite common for scientists to grow and use human tissues in medical research. The [HeLa cell line](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa) due to the controversy surrounding the family's lack of compensation. These cells were harvested from the cervical cancer of a woman names Henrietta Lacks, and have been propagated in labs around the world since (some labs are making profits growing and selling them to other labs). They are extensively used in cancer research, so overall a good thing to have, but does the family of Ms. Lacks deserve a cut of this profit?

Anyway, two other cell lines (both from aborted fetuses from the 1960s) are commonly used in vaccine research and development. 

So the answer is, kind of. They aren't buying fetuses from Planned Parenthood and grinding them up to add to the vaccine. But some vaccines were developed using these cell lines. Note that many drugs also make use of such cell lines, it'd be very hard to avoid them all. Cell lines like these are one of the foundations of modern medical research.",1/31/20 20:19
Comment,1,fg40ao1,,0,1580493461,"No, there are no aborted fetal cells in vaccines.  
> The production of a few vaccines, including those for varicella, rubella, and hepatitis A, involves growing the viruses in human cell culture. Two human cell lines provide the cell cultures needed for producing vaccines; these lines were developed from two legally aborted fetuses in the 1960s. These cell lines are maintained to have an indefinite life span. No fetal tissue has been added since the cell lines were originally created.
Some parents are concerned about this issue because of misinformation they have encountered on the Internet. Two such untrue statements are that ongoing abortions are needed to manufacture vaccines and vaccines are contaminated with fetal tissue.  

https://www.immunize.org/askexperts/vaccine-safety.asp  

The cell lines came from abortions due to congenital rubella syndrome resulting from a 1964 rubella epidemic.  
https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/503157  
The vaccines that were developed because of these two cell lines have prevented an estimated 10+ million deaths.  
The rubella vaccine prevented over 633,000 miscarriages in the U.S. alone, and countless more across the globe, and it has prevented tens of millions of clinical health issues in children.

Dr. Theresa Deisher finds correlation between human fetal DNA in vaccines and Autism.
https://www.soundchoice.org/scpiJournalPubHealthEpidem092014.pdf “ Broadening changes in diagnostic criteria for ASD complicate interpretation of the current epidemic. Therefore, we focused on autistic disorder (previously called infantile autism), the most severe form of ASD, which has relatively constant diagnostic criteria over the past 5 decades”",1/31/20 18:54
